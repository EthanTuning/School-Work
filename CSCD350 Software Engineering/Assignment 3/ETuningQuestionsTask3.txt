Questions

1. What exactly is NMEA 0183 format?

2. Within the Latitude and Longitude constructors, how does the 
   encoding of a double to NMEA work?

3. Within the ShapeArc class, interpolateDelta() I am not quite
   understanding, could you elaborate what exactly this process
   is doing.

4. Within the CoordinatesScreen class, regarding the isVisible() methods
   does this literally mean visible on the screen?
