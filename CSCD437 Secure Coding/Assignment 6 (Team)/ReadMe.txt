Instructions: Compile C version using gcc with all the appropriate flags ON A LINUX SYSTEM.
	      Compile Java version using javac ON A LIXUX SYSTEM as well.

Fixes: 1. Made sure that the java version did not integer overflow. Also made sure the int
          arithmetic was correct.
       2. Made sure the C version compiled with all the "extra flags". Had to move all
	  variable declarations to top of code blocks.
