Assignment: Simple Web Server
Tools: Notepad++, javac, windows 10, command line, google chrome.

This program is a simple web server that supports .css, .html, and .gif
file formats. It was pretty straight forward. I wrote HttpRequest class
in java, as well as the actual driver called WebServer.java. I had no
road blocks during the creation of the classes. Everything works correctly.
I wrote a little html mockup, and a css style sheet just to show the server
knows what to when I asked for an html doc. If I type 
http://localhost:6789/index.html the html doc is displayed with the style 
rules from the css file.
